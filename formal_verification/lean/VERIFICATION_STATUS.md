# Verification status

The model covers only the cached circuits. Production sets use_caches = true.

## Proofs

All three machine targets are proved.
Their definitions stay unchanged. Cached Review claims remain.
Uncached-only Review cases and statements are removed with user approval.
The split Keccak source certificates are proved.
Exact lookup, request and RAM premises stay explicit.
The verified base is `c1a662222cafcd96db4383dce737edb79fa62b09`.
The local initialization-window fix remains in this branch.

## Current checkpoint

The tag `fv-archive-uncached` records the branch before scope removal.

The uncached captures and captured-program compatibility modules are removed.
Old arithmetic, functional and frame shard projections are removed.
All 58 focused source builds for this deletion pass.
The cached native acceptance theorems remain in the production gate.
Three [native corollaries](Airbender/Review/Compiler/Theorems.lean) compose them
with the full unsigned, reduced and unified target proofs.
Their focused source builds pass.
Item 3 has stopped. No more fact families will be converted.
FV CI is configured for nightly and manual runs on the large runner.
The nightly schedule starts when the workflow reaches the default branch.
One freshness step checks all 52 generator routes.
It also requires tracked Airbender imports to resolve to tracked sources.
The cold source queue includes the top-level `Airbender.lean` module.
Its focused source build passes after the stale imports are removed.
The tracked-import check covers 12,078 imports in 4,212 Lean files.
The earlier log is in [VERIFICATION_HISTORY.md](VERIFICATION_HISTORY.md).
The final axiom inventory and baseline refresh remain pending.
[PR #585](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-airbender/pull/585) is open and mergeable.
The full FV gate must pass before merge.
The history rewrite signed all 768 commits. Later commits are signed.
GitHub verifies the signed head.
The signing rewrite leaves the source tree unchanged.

## Plan

1. The three deletion commits are complete. Their focused source builds pass.
2. Run FV only at night or on manual dispatch, on the large runner.
   Use one generator freshness step. Keep the existing checkers.
3. Run one final cold build, full frontend and transitive kernel replay.
   Use a 2,048 MiB stack. Run the environment audit and refresh the baseline.
   Record module time, peak memory and totals in one table.
4. Fix only validation failures. Do not change a target or cached Review claim.

## Runtime

The user moved final validation to the large CI runner.
[Run 41451555538](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-airbender/actions/runs/41451555538)
stopped at signed commit `6031819e9f8e76f4acc351a0b1af8c8bf7ee5dd3`.
All 12 native generators, all 16 setup exports, the complete setup inventory,
and the compiler-capture freshness checks pass. The cold pass built 2,756 modules.
The next module rejected the reserved `parts` binder in `ShiftAssembly.lean`.
The fix quotes that binder and the same reserved syntax in two adjacent consumers.
The Lean names and theorems stay unchanged.
All three focused source builds and all 52 generator checks pass.
CI now saves cold build progress after failure.
The corrected [run 41546838677](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-airbender/actions/runs/41546838677)
is running at `d1423ca72`. Its Lean inputs stay unchanged by the GPU CI fix.
The earlier run rejected three omitted split Keccak exports. The CI list is fixed.
The repaired run reuses saved native build caches.
The registered Rust CI workflow provides the manual entry.
It calls the same FV workflow. Other Rust jobs skip this manual run.
FV stays off PR runs. Nightly runs retain their normal baseline comparison.
This manual run requests a cold build and a baseline refresh.
It restores no project Lean objects. Each cold module gets a time and memory receipt.
The job exports the refreshed baseline only after a passing environment audit.
The transitive replay uses a 2,048 MiB stack and checks all safe dependencies.

The duplicate local Mac frontend and Docker cold run stopped at the user's request.
Their caches and partial reports remain. Neither is a full validation result.
The local worker now runs the separate Lean 4.35 and turbo experiment.
That experiment does not change this PR's Lean 4.31 toolchain.

Focused builds pass for the cached native acceptance path, all three native
corollaries and the changed compiler/protocol aggregate imports.
All 52 generator routes pass. These focused results do not replace the full gate.
`Source.ChiCharacters` uses the measured 1,800-second source allowance.
Other source leaves retain 900 seconds. Memory caps and kernel checks stay unchanged.

## Final validation

| Phase | State | Time (s) | Peak footprint (MiB) |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| CI cold source partial, 2,756 of 4,202 modules | Stopped at parse failure | 33,462.48 | 2,198.55 |
| CI `ShiftAssembly` parse failure | Fixed; focused source passes | 4.62 | 353.58 |
| CI full frontend and runtime gates | Queued | Pending | Pending |
| CI environment audit and baseline refresh | Queued | Pending | Pending |
| CI full transitive replay, 2,048 MiB stack | Queued | Pending | Pending |
| Local Linux cold partial, 857 modules | Stopped; moved to CI | 8,383.54 | 2,202.59 |
| Local Mac frontend partial | Stopped; moved to CI | 5,108.33 | 2,100.26 |
| Local Linux `Source.ChiCharacters` cold leaf | Passed | 1,133.67 | 540.31 |

The CI and Linux partial times sum module guard times. The Mac time is wall time.
The failed CI artifact retains `cold-build/modules.jsonl` and all failure logs.
The complete cold pass will also export `cold-build/modules.md`.
These times include Lake startup and dependency freshness checks.
CI uploads commands, resource receipts and failure logs from each stage.
Local partial evidence remains in `/tmp/airbender-review-round/method-reset-2026-11-02/`.
No duplicate local full audit or replay is scheduled.
The hourly task follows the CI run and the separate focused upgrade experiment.

## PR checks

The Rust warnings jobs found a stale call in the initialization-window test.
The test now uses the current five-argument verifier generator.
The generator derives packing and batching parameters from its configuration.
At commit `8ca339867`, 22 PR checks passed and the IaC scanner was neutral.
No ordinary check failed or stayed pending. The FV PR job skips as configured.
The GPU smoke at `d1423ca72` then failed twice on the L4 runner.
It could not allocate another 1 GiB after allocating 20,564,675,584 bytes.
The CI command now requests the supported 128 MiB guest RAM setting.
Proof generation and verification remain required. The corrected GPU check is pending.
The separate full FV run must pass before merge.
Production code stays unchanged.
