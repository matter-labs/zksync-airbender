# Native v2 reduced-machine intake

[Artifact](Artifact.lean) imports the actual combined v2 CPU, with 119 equations,
eight scalar and eight timestamp lookups and six tagged lookup queries. Two tags
are native sign/high-byte ID 16; four are original witness expressions. All four
fields use the same explicit fixed setup table, following the current v3 unified
importer pattern with v2 width and coefficients. No disabled row or extra gating
is inserted. Complete source bytes and validated state/decoder/direct memory,
initialization/teardown and delegation-request coordinates are retained. The
existing shift/CSR request keeps its separate coordinates and absent ABI group;
unsupported profiles and invented ABI columns reject.

[Structural checks](../../../Proofs/ReducedMachine/ArtifactChecks.lean) live under
Proofs; [intake controls](../../../../Tests/ReducedMachineImport.lean) and
[emission controls](../../../../Tests/ReducedMachineEmission.lean) retain the
supported and rejected profiles. The complete bounded module, importer, axiom and Review gates pass.

This module supplies no execution theorem. Actual fixed-table contents and
public ROM/CSR binding, decoder membership, initialized combined history,
worker/caller accounting, physical arguments and terminal/padding boundaries
remain open. Stage-two source descriptors are opaque. Table input alone supplies
no setup correctness and cannot close a native-machine claim.
See the [current adaptation map](../../../../V3_ADAPTATION.md) and
[active plan](../../../../FORMAL_VERIFICATION_PLAN.md).
