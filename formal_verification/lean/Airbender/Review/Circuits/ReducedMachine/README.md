# Native v2 reduced machine

The active target is [NativeArtifact](NativeArtifact.lean), regenerated from the
unchanged pinned Rust. Start with its [full fixed pool](Tables/Native.lean) and
[short local theorem](Theorems.lean). Both actual sign/high-byte queries follow
from original Clean acceptance. Instruction and execution soundness remain open.
The historical intake below stays separate.

[The historical artifact](Artifact.lean) imports the pinned combined v2 JSON, with 119 equations,
eight scalar and eight timestamp lookups and six tagged lookup queries. Two tags
are native sign/high-byte ID 16; four are original witness expressions. All four
fields use the same explicit fixed setup table, following the current v3 unified
importer pattern with v2 width and coefficients. No disabled row or extra gating
is inserted. Complete source bytes and validated state/decoder/direct memory,
initialization/teardown and delegation-request coordinates are retained. The
existing shift/CSR request keeps its separate coordinates and absent ABI group;
unsupported profiles and invented ABI columns reject.

[Structural checks](../../../Proofs/ReducedMachine/ArtifactChecks.lean) live under
Proofs; [intake controls](../../../../Tests/ReducedMachineImport.lean) and
[emission controls](../../../../Tests/ReducedMachineEmission.lean) retain the
supported and rejected profiles. The complete intake checkpoint passed its bounded gates; the separate fixed-region
addition passed targeted modules/importer/exporter checks and the complete axiom
and public Review audits.

[The native sign/high-byte certificate](Tables/SignHigh.lean) checks all 65,536
literal rows of the registered ID-16 region at the actual reduced offset 196609.
[Its calculations](../../../Proofs/ReducedMachine/SignHigh.lean) stay under Proofs;
[semantic regressions](../../../../Tests/ReducedSignHigh.lean) cover byte/sign
boundaries and altered key/sign/high-byte/tag rejection. The
[strict literal importer](../../../Import/ReducedSetup.lean) validates geometry
and canonical encoding, while the kernel proves contents; parsing alone makes
no semantic assertion. [Importer controls](../../../../Tests/ReducedSignHighImport.lean)
retain that distinction. The FV-only exporter calls the unchanged registered
native table generator. No production circuit code is changed.

This historical intake supplies no execution theorem. Universal public ROM/CSR
binding, decoder membership, initialized combined history,
worker/caller accounting, physical arguments and terminal/padding boundaries
remain open. Stage-two source descriptors are opaque. Table input alone supplies
no setup correctness and cannot close a native-machine claim.
See the [current adaptation map](../../../../V3_ADAPTATION.md) and
[active plan](../../../../FORMAL_VERIFICATION_PLAN.md).

[NativeArtifact](NativeArtifact.lean) is separately regenerated from unchanged
pinned Rust and has 117 equations, 142 variables and fourteen native fixed
regions. The historical artifact has 119 equations, 141 variables and thirteen
regions. Their constraints and coverage are not assumed interchangeable.

[The full native pool](Tables/Native.lean) imports every actual tagged row and
explicit public image/CSR input of the retained fixture.
[Region/tag calculations](../../../Proofs/ReducedMachine/NativePool.lean) recover
exact sign/high-byte membership. [The short row theorem](Theorems.lean) derives
both actual constant queries from original Clean acceptance.
[Mechanical native checks](../../../Proofs/ReducedMachine/NativeArtifactChecks.lean)
retain every query and changed init/request coordinate.
[Pool regressions](../../../../Tests/NativeReducedPool.lean) and
[native/historical intake controls](../../../../Tests/NativeReducedImport.lean)
keep scope and configuration separation explicit. The
[scoped native gate](../../../../scripts/check_native_setup.py) reproduces the
compiler artifact and all fourteen regions, including changed/empty public
inputs and UNIMP padding. No production circuit code is changed.

The active claim is specific to its retained public fixed fixture. Other operation
semantics, universal public/physical setup, full decoding/history and execution
remain open. Current v3 source material does not close those v2 obligations.
