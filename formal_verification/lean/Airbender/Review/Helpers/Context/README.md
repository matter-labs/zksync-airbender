# Shared context review

[Timestamp](Timestamps.lean) and [column](Columns.lean) definitions preserve the
source formalization's two 19-bit clock limbs, four-tick step and three ordered
port slots. Clock inputs expose initial/prior bounds and alignment; clock effects
state derived advancement and strict previous-write ordering.

[Native ADD/SUB extraction](../../../Proofs/AddSub/Timestamp.lean) connects the
v2 equations and all eight timestamp queries to the unchanged generic clock
lemmas. [Native row data and logical matching](Model.lean) preserve the source's
small registry/token structure, restricted to v2 ADD/SUB. The
[PC/state representation](PCState/Model.lean) retains raw PC/time pairs; unconnected
v3 modeled decoder tables are omitted; native v2 ten-column decoder placement is
retained by the row registry, separately from table membership.

[History proofs](../../../Proofs/Trace/History.lean) derive row/prior clock bounds
and alignment from accepted state/memory matching and only initial clock inputs.
V2's two carry equations replace the source's BabyBear inverse argument. These
context definitions have no whole-execution dependency.

[Word-memory registry](WordMemory.lean) separately binds the checked word-memory
artifact, mixed ports, ten-column decoder query and native ROM setup type. Its
[public decoding](../../Trace/Families/WordMemory/Decoder.lean) now recovers actual
LW/SW source evidence. Initialized word-memory history/Sail execution remain
pending; the existing arithmetic execution registry is unchanged.
