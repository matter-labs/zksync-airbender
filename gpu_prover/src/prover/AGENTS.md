This directory is governed by the [GPU Scheduling Contract](../../docs/gpu_scheduling_contract.md).
Before editing any file here, you MUST read the full contract. Violations
break the async scheduling model in ways that often pass tests but fail
under load, under pool recycling, or under stream-overlap.

The cheatsheet below summarizes the rules most often violated. It is a
summary — the contract document is the source of truth.

- **MUST NOT** dereference pool-backed device or host allocations from the
  scheduling thread. All reads and writes must be expressed as stream ops:
  kernel launches, `memory_copy_async`, or host callbacks scheduled via
  `Callbacks::schedule` / `launch_host_fn`. `UnsafeAccessor::get()` /
  `UnsafeMutAccessor::get_mut()` are only valid inside stream-scheduled
  closures.
- **MUST** fill stream-ordered H2D staging buffers via a scheduled host
  callback (captured `UnsafeMutAccessor`). `.copy_from_slice(...)` right after
  allocation races the prior pool owner's outstanding DMA, even when it
  appears to work.
- **`SchedulerHostAllocator` is the separate pinned host pool for immutable,
  scheduling-time-known H2D sources** (compiled kernel descriptors, recipe
  tables, etc.). Its access rule is **inverted** vs. the stream-ordered pool:
  the scheduling thread writes once during construction, and every stream
  operation thereafter only reads.
- **MUST** consume D2H readback buffers via a scheduled host callback, never
  from the scheduling thread.
- **MUST** fork/join any op on an auxiliary stream (`h2d_stream` or `d2h_stream`)
  against `exec_stream` with explicit CUDA events. The driver gives independent
  streams no implicit ordering.
- **MUST** allocate and drop pool-backed handles on `exec_stream`. If a
  secondary stream touched the allocation, the `exec_stream` join wait must be
  scheduled before the Rust drop — otherwise it is a use-after-free.
- **MUST** observe write-exclusivity within any fork/join window: exactly one
  stream writes a shared buffer. Concurrent reads are fine; concurrent writes,
  or a read racing a write across streams, are not.
- **MUST** keep a Rust handle alive until every op holding a raw pointer into
  it (via accessors or embedding structs) has been **scheduled**. Scheduling
  is enough — completion is not required.
- **MUST NOT** call any CUDA API from within a host callback, and callbacks
  must not create or destroy pool-backed allocations. Callbacks exist to
  compute challenge-dependent host data only.
- **MUST** keep `prove()` enqueue-only. No `stream.synchronize()`, no host
  blocking for `exec_stream` progress — not even for profiling or logging.
  Host blocking belongs in `GpuGKRProofJob::finish()`.
- **Default to `exec_stream`** for H2D/D2H copies. Use `h2d_stream` /
  `d2h_stream` only when meaningful copy/compute overlap justifies the
  fork/join machinery.
